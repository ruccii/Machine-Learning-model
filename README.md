# Machine-Learning-model
Breast cancer prediction
Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## OBjective:
- To study the dataset available on breast cancer and predict the results to use it for predictions.
- To do an exploratory data analysis on the data
- Create an ML-model & do a comparative analysis of all the models to conclude to our best ML-model for prediction of breast cancer

## Importing packages & lib-dependencies:
- import warnings
- import numpy
- import pandas
- import matplotlib.pyplot (for visualization of data)
- import seaborn
- import sklearn.model (all ml-algorithms are available in this library)

## Data set:
- Dataset for this project is available on this kaggle as [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/code)

## ML-Model:
- Fitting in ML -> process storing required data and predicting the result is called fittig in machine learning
- Independent variable : a variable which is not dependable on other entity.
- Dependent variable :  a variable which is dependable on other entity.
- Train-test split model is used for ML model to train machine for required dataset and testing the machine for prediction results inorder to reach to our best model conclusion.

## Anaconda Navigator:
- It is an GUI for desktop which allows to launch applications and easily manage conda packages.
- It provides with an environment and channel for programming without launchng command line.
- It contains coding applications like spyder orange,jupyter lab,jupyter notebook,glue,visual studio code etc.

## Jupyter Notebbok:
- Open web source application that allows to create & share documents that contain live code ,equations,visualizations and narrative texts.
- It uses extensions as .pynb where py stands for python.
- It is used to write codes as it allows more clear and neat visualization of python coding.
- It is a web based interface so it opens in browser but doesnt require internet connectivity.

## Jovian:
- It is a platform for sharing and collaborating an jupyter notebooks and data-science projects.

## Open a project folder through command line:
- Select a particular folder in OS and copy the location of folder where you wish to create ML-project
- Open windows and click on Anaconda prompt
- Type cd ==> cd stands for change directory and paste the location path of project folder
- add the directory initial followed by colon
- your project folder will open up in notebook
